# About me

After 5 years working for a non-profit open data start up (Figure.NZ) working in all areas of the organisation from data visualisation, product management to marketing, operations and HR - I am after a new challenge.

I am interested in work that includes strategy, advisory services, PeopleOps, team processes, organisation culture, and how we get people working together to create great things. Problem solving is my jam, and my mantra is ‘I don’t know but I will figure it out’.

I am working to be my authentic self, and through kindness, encourage others to be their best self. I find opportunity through connection, and truly believe that by helping others, we all benefit.



## Experience

**Product Manager at Figure.NZ**

**Mar 2013 – Sep 2018**

Helped take Figure.NZ from a 2-person start-up non-profit to a 10-person sustainable organisation. My role has varied throughout my time here, starting with data visualisation, marketing and communications, research and strategy. Most recently my role has been in product management, coordinating the development, product teams with the rest of the organisation. I also gained experience in onboarding, team management, remote working and managing people as we scale.

**Key achievements:**

- Part of research and building of the data processing platform behind the website, which provides us the ability to process, standardise datasets into tables, and then create custom and templated charts from the data easily and efficiently.
- Performed several iterations of the website into its current form today.
- Successful collaboration with a large bank to deliver a product designed to help SMEs make more informed decisions. Work from creating this product also informed us how to better link and relate various datasets together for better search results for the main website and structure for the data processing platform.
